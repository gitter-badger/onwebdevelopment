# Drawings

**The drawings conceptualize what your application's schema and interface look like.** Getting to real screens and real data is important for effective communicatation between you, your team, and potential customers. Customers at this phase will be able to playtest on paper; discovering usability issues and sparking feature requests. Maximize the low cost of making a change to drawings by exploring as many variations as possible. Copy and paste is your friend here; select a screen, copy it over, edit it, and repeat. In contrast, making the same change in code often requires adding a new URL route, connecting that route to a new controller method, which renders out a new HTML template, has new CSS style, and additional JavaScript added behavior.
