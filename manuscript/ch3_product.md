# Product

**The product is the implementation of your vision.** There is no state of "done" here; your product needs to be treated like art. You'll never nail down what it is or what it can be, but by keeping to a clear vision you'll be headed in the right direction. Because of the hard work involved in building things versus imagining them, this phase requires 99% of your time. Feel comfortable pushing back changes to Drawings and especially the README vision, but be flexible when a required change is glaringly obvious. Think in terms of 2 week feature sprints and do not make excuses for failing to meet a deadline. Achieving deadlines on budget is a must for progress and team morale. Shrink scope to make it happen.

Bring in testing to ensure regression support during rapid development. Plan to scale and be international from the beginning, but be reactive when it comes to investing resources.
