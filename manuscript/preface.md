# Preface

I volunteered to teach web development for a workplace Lunch and Learn series held early 2015. I knew my audience was largely non-technical, so I prepped a one hour workshop that would have every attendee leaving with their very own unique application on paper. My ambitious expectations were naive for the one hour time limit, but the experience offered me a better understanding of my own informal process. And this book is meant to formalize and offer that learning to others to consume at their own pace.

On Web Development is a treatise to combat the inherent complexity and evolving nature of this subset within the larger software engineering discipline. First is the minimalist approach to documentation. Advocates constant revisions. Start with the core of the problem, visualize your interface, and race to running code. Forwarning there isn't a line of code used.
