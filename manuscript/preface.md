# Preface

I volunteered to teach web development for a workplace Lunch and Learn series held early 2015. I was optimistic that every attendee could leave with their very own unique app on paper. The greatest adversity was my audiences' lack of technical knowledge with web development. Ok so they weren't going to learn about the MVC pattern, view frameworks, and schema normalization over lunch. However they were smart and opportunities to outsource or partner with a developer has never been greater. So in preparation I reexamined my workflow and dutifully refactored down to three core activities I could explain to a fifth grader. The one hour time limit turned out to be just a bit too short, but the experience has resulted into this book. This free ebook is meant to formalize and offer that learning to others to consume at their own pace.

**Chapter 1 Readme** is a single page document serving as the application's manifest; codifying the vision by highlighting the problem and solution addressed. **Chapter 2 Drawings** visualizes the specific interfaces the user interacts with and the schema used to store data. **Chapter 3 Product** contains principles and methods to implement when racing to running code. The concepts within are technology agnostic and you are guaranteed to not see a single line of code.
