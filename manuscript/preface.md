# Preface

I volunteered to teach web development for a workplace Lunch and Learn series held early 2015. I knew my audience was largely non-technical, so I prepped a one hour workshop that would have every attendee leaving with their very own unique application on paper. My ambitious expectations were naive for the one hour time limit, but the experience offered me a better understanding of my own informal process. And this book is meant to formalize and offer that learning to others to consume at their own pace.

**Chapter 1 Readme** is a single page document serving as the application's manifest; codifying the vision by highlighting the problem and solution addressed. **Chapter 2 Drawings** visualizes the specific interfaces the user interacts with and the schema used to store data. **Chapter 3 Product** contains principles and methods to implement when racing to running code. The concepts within are technology agnostic and you are guaranteed to not see a single line of code.
