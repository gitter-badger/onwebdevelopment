# Preface

For a lunch and learn series, held at my workplace, I volunteered to teach web development. Knowing my audience held non-technical backgrounds I prepped a one hour workshop that would have every attendee leaving with their very own unique application on paper.

On Web Development is a treatise to combat the inherent complexity and evolving nature of this subset within the larger software engineering discipline. First is the minimalist approach to documentation. Advocates constant revisions. Start with the core of the problem, visualize your interface, and race to running code. Forwarning there isn't a line of code used.
