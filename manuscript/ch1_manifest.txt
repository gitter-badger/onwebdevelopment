# Manifest
A vision statement, the shorter the better (2 words).
Motivational quote that embodies that vision.
A problem narrative that's personal and hyper critical.
A solution narrative that's hopeful and revolutionary.

It is a moving document.
Don't iterate application or drawings if your vision is the problem.
Make updates to the manifest as you pivot vision.
