# Readme



**The README replaces the blank slate or void with a lofty vision for your web application to strive towards.** Once set, it'll serve as a set of constraints that enable analytical decision making and reduce guesswork. Making changes early to the vision before any line of code is written saves you time, money, and team morale.

A README with vision is comprised of a mission statement, motivational quote, a problem narrative, and solution narrative. The vision statement benefits from brevity and should be the first thing you think of when asked, "What does your application do?". The motivational quote ought to come from an authority you respect and be relevant enough to seemingly be spoken directly to your team. A problem narrative is why your application will have value; the greater the problem the greater the value. A solution narrative that's hopeful and revolutionary.
