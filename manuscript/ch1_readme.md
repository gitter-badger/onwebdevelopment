# Readme



<b>The README replaces the blank slate or void with a lofty vision for your web application to strive towards.</b> Once set, it'll serve as a set of constraints that enable analytical decision making and reduce guesswork. Making changes early to the vision before any line of code is written saves you time, money, and team morale.

A README with vision is comprised of a mission statement, motivational quote, a problem narrative, and solution narrative. The vision statement benefits from brevity and should be the first thing you think of when asked, "What does your application do?". The motivational quote ought to embody the vision. A problem narrative benefits from being personal and critical. A solution narrative that's hopeful and revolutionary.
