# Readme

## What is a README and why do I need it?

**The README replaces the blank slate with a lofty vision for your web application to strive towards.** Once set, it'll serve as a set of constraints that enable analytical decision making and reduce guesswork. Making changes early to the vision before any line of code is written saves you time, money, and team morale.

A README with vision is comprised of a mission statement, motivational quote, a problem narrative, and solution narrative. The mission statement benefits from brevity and should be the first thing you think of when asked, "What does your application do?". The motivational quote ought to come from an authority you respect and be relevant enough to seemingly be spoken directly to your team. A problem narrative is why your application will have value; the greater the problem the greater the value. A solution narrative should have forseeable good fit with the problem.

### Bad Habits
_**The detrimental things we do routinely.**_

I formed my TV habit when I was young. One of my earliest childhood memories was sitting down with my family for an afternoon of binge television. In that house there was the one TV, whereas today I'd guess we have 5; nope, after a physical count it's 8. That number doesn't include the iPad, iPod, and iPhone each capable of streaming the same content. And let's talk content; alongside this increase in viewer accessibility, providers are producing more high quality series. Some of my favorite closed-series include House, The Office, and Psych. Each of the three are an average 8+ seasons of 150+ episodes and at an average of 42 minutes per episode total 18,900 hours of entertainment. In a single 24 hour day I don't know the total number of hours I spend passively consuming multimedia, but it feels excessive. And while it's entertainment that's relatively harmless, the effect is similar to excessive consumption of junk food; detrimental to my health and well being. To counter act these external forces conspiring against my better judgment, I'd like a tool that offers me control of habits I form or let atrophy.

### Zen Habits
_**Learn to breathe and everything will follow.**_

Leo Babauta, author of the blog Zen Habits, shares patterns that have helped him simplify his life. In his own life he was able to find happiness while raising 6 kids, quitting smoking, and running marathons. The majority of his posts discuss how to develop sustainable change within yourself and improve your well being. He highlights the importance of restructuring a seemingly impossible challenge into a collection of smaller activities that are enjoyable. He advocates daily training sessions to avoid procrastination and using a 3 day interval to reflect on what does and doesn't work. He celebrates just doing the habit in whatever way possible. He reminds you to forgive yourself when you fail, that you're human, and that you have the opportunity to begin again.

### Lost Opportunities
_**Why not having something is bad.**_

Each hike has at least one specific panoramic view that I like to recall. The 2007 Alaska High Adventure Trip has snowy peaks of a distant mountain ridge parallel to the one we had just climbed. I cherish those snowy peaks, but I'm also mindful of the effort that came before. That climb was the culmination of 5 days of hiking with the level of preparation you get after 7 years of Boy Scout camp-outs. We required hand-pumped filters to replenish our Nalgenes with drinking water. We navigated across multiple fields of scree, loose and jagged boulders the result of physical weathering from glacial erosion, where our hiking poles ensured stable footing. With an Alaskan summer having 22 hours of daylight we used nightshades to keep a regular sleep cycle and energy levels high. Each item in our pack was thoughtful in it's purpose. And I'd like to maintain this level of thoughtfulness with all my belongings. Because wither in an emergency, daily routine, or whim each second is an opportunity for a moment of my life and the things I own determine my level of preparedness.

### Stoicism
_**A philosophy for peaceful contentedness.**_

Seneca, author of the seneca letters, taught Stoicism as a philosophy for the common man in search of "moral and intellectual perfection". Arguable his most influential letters were correspondence between friends across the Graeco-Roman world who were also practicing Stoicism. In my readings I found three specific lessons that applied to the ownership of stuff. First, to avoid hording because "nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in mere passing". Second, to not give way to jealousy for "it is not the man who has too little who is poor but the man who hankers for more". Third, to consider the limit of wealth to be "having what is essential, and then, having what is enough". In addition, and perhaps more important, is the recurring counsel towards deliberate nurturing of friendships. Therefore a physical thing could best be held up and valued by which it strengthens or weakens those relationships.

### Greener Pastures
_**Why good is never good enough.**_

I grew up playing video games. Whatever was the most recent and fashionable on the market I owned it. First it was all things Mario on the Nintendo consoles; starting with Nintendo 64, Nintendo Gamecube, and Nintendo Wii. Second was the Halo franchise I played on Microsoft's consoles; starting with the original Xbox, then Xbox 360, followed by Xbox One. The greatest time sink was World of Warcraft, which required a subscription of $30 per month; a game I played on my first custom built PC. The winding point here is I followed the trends when selecting what games to play and I spent the majority of my savings to do it. For the last four years I've played one game, Dwarf Fortress, which asserts "Losing is fun!". Dwarf Fortress is a part construction and management simulation, part roguelike, indie video game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. It's free, donation-driven development, and is one of those rare games with unlimited replay value. In other areas of my life I want to do the same; making purchases that optimize for long-term happiness and are not driven by short-term market forces.

### New Rich
_**Avoid the deferred-life plan.**_

Tim Ferriss, author of the 4-Hour Workweek, offers an alternative path for the 9 to 5 workaholic questioning why they'd wait for retirement to live their dreams. His approach to joining the new rich includes four activities; definition, elimination, automation, and liberation. The process, coined DEAL, begins with defining your ideal lifestyle and worst case scenarios. Next he focuses on the 20% of activities generating 80% of the desired results and eliminates the 20% of activities causing 80% of the headache. Once effective, the next step is to become efficient by applying degrees of automation to critical activities. Lastly is liberation from environment-restrictive productivity through modern remote practices. The end goal is to increase the number of options available and reduce the costs to change.
